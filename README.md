# Note Taker

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

My motivation for this project was to build a note taking app so that it can be digitally saved rather than having to write it on pen and paper. This problem solves for the business owner to easily jot down notes on a computer rather than paper. I learned express a lot more.

## Installation

Open up your integrated terminal in server.js. Then, host your local server at port 3001, When you open your URL make sure its http://localhost:3001 and then follow the note taker steps.
